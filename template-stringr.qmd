Want to learn more about working with regex *without* the `stringr` package functions? Read a nice introduction from Roger Peng [HERE](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/regular-expressions.html).

Always check out the package cheatsheets especially how to use regex.

[Cheatsheet for stringr](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf)

## Useful functions in `stringr`

Use the `vec` object below and the `starwars` dataset to test out some stringr functions. Run the code chunk below and use `View(starwars)` in your console.

```{r}
# Make a little vector
vec <- c("  A Unicorn     Fish", 
         " add   Cornmeal ", 
         " Herbivore Carnivore  ",
         "  French FRIES", 
         " acorn squash  ")
```


### Change string case

It can also be useful to update the *case* of strings in your code. Since, for example, "Fish" will be seen entirely differently from "fish". We can use the `str_to_*()` functions to change the case.

-   `str_to_lower()': changes each word to lower case
-   `str_to_upper()`: changes each word to upper case
-   `str_to_title(): first letter after a space is capitalized
-   `str_trim()`: trims spaces before or after character
-   `str_squish()`: once space between words

Apply each function individually to the `vec` object. Describe what each function does.

```{r}
vec
str_to_lower <- str_to_lower(vec)
str_to_lower

str_to_title <- str_to_title(vec)
str_to_title

str_trim(vec)
```

### Detect a pattern

Use `stringr::str_detect()` to detect a string pattern. For example, if I want to look for any element of `vec` that has "corn" in it, I can run the following code. How might this be useful? Did I catch every instance of "corn" in the data? Why or why not? Create a way to fix it with code!


```{r}
# detect a string pattern: 
str_detect(vec, pattern = "corn")
# for each character, do we see corn?

vec |>
  str_to_lower() |>
  str_detect(pattern = "corn")
```

We see that it returns a T/F vector indicating whether or not the pattern "corn" exists within each element of the vector.

How might we use that in a data frame? It can be helpful to use `str_detect()` within `filter()` to only keep observations that contain that pattern in the specified variable.

Now use `filter()` and `str_detect()` to filter only characters whose name is Skywalker from the `starwars` dataset. Using "walk" as your pattern.

```{r}
starwars |>
  filter(str_detect(name, pattern = "walk"))
  
```

### First Regex

Our first catwalking across a keyboard shows how much more adaptive code can be when looking for text patterns. What happens when I update the pattern using simple regex? What now gets counted as the pattern?

```{r}
str_detect(str_to_lower(vec),pattern="c.rn")  # first example of a regex  '.' is a wildcard meaning any single letter can go between c and rn
```

The "Carnivore" also gets count because it as a "c.rn" pattern.

Here's a more complicated regex. This time, we're filtering out characters whose name is entirely capitalized.

```{r}

### Regex example: two or more cap letters!
cap_subset <- starwars |> 
  filter(str_detect(name, pattern = '[A-Z]{2,}')) 
  ### NOTE: NO SPACE AFTER COMMA
  ### Regex is powerful but complicated, like the force!
```

### Replace a pattern

Use `stringr::str_replace()` to replace a pattern with something else.

```{r}
str_replace(vec, pattern = "r", replacement = "ARRR") ### replaces first instance only

# use replace_all to replace all instances in each string 
str_replace_all(vec, pattern = "a", replacement = "ZZZ")
```

In the `starwars` data, let's replace any "Sky" string pattern with "CIELO", overwriting the existing `name` column.

```{r}

sw_cielo <- starwars |> 
  mutate(name = str_replace(name, pattern = "Sky", replacement = "CIELO"))
```

And we can use these things in combination, usually within `mutate()` if it's to update a column in a data frame.

Use your data wrangling skills to turn all names in the `starwars` data to lower case. Then filter out all the Sith with "Darth" titles in their names. Finally, bring balance to the force and change their names to "happy".

```{r}
happy <- starwars |>
  mutate(name = str_to_lower(name)) |>
  filter(str_detect(name, pattern = "darth")) |>
  mutate(name = str_replace(name, pattern = "darth", replacement = "happy"))
```

Here's another example with regex. Best way to interpret the cat walking is look for any lower or uppercase w followed by a b or a. Remove everything after the last observed letter.

```{r}
sw_wawa <- starwars |> 
  mutate(name2 = str_replace(name, pattern = '(w|W)b?a.+', replacement = 'WAWA')) |> 
  select(name, name2)
```


## Other useful functions in `stringr`

`str_extract`/`str_extract_all` to grab all instances that match a pattern (useful when using regex pattern strings)

```{r}
sw_firstnames <- starwars |> 
  mutate(firstname = str_extract(name, '[A-Za-z0-9]+')) |>  ### EXCLUDES spaces and punctuation
  select(name, firstname)
```

`str_locate` to identify positions of matches (regex or otherwise) - trickier to use in a dataframe but possible!

```{r}
sw_where_sky <- starwars$name |> 
  str_to_lower() |> 
  str_locate('sky')
```

`str_sub` to extract characters by position in a string

```{r}
sw_abbr <- starwars |> 
  select(name, homeworld) |> 
  mutate(homeworld_abbr = str_sub(homeworld, start = 1, end = 3))
```
